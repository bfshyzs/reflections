When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

A remote repository is advisable when there is more than 1 person working
on a project that is under GIT version control.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually put the control in the hands of the user as to when the
local repository is updated, and also, what branch to pull.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

A git clone is a copy of a git repository.
A git fork is a copy of a git repository that still maintains a relationship
with the original repository.
A branch is a separate line of changes for an artifact within a repository.
These changes may be made for various reasons, defect fix, new enhancement, etc.

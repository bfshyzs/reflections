When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

A remote repository is advisable when there is more than 1 person working
on a project that is under GIT version control.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually put the control in the hands of the user as to when the
local repository is updated, and also, what branch to pull.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git init will create an empty repository


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The repository is a container for files that are under version control.
The staging area is a container for files that are destine for the repository.
The working area is a container for files that are destine for the repository
and some that may not be.
The staging area provides a means to group logically related files together for
a single commit operation.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Execute a git status to see what is in the current staging area; that would be
part of a subsequent git commit.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

In creating experimental version or different versions of the app for a bug fix
or new feature.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

You can see all the various commits that compose a specific branch.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

The graph shows the parent of a specific commit that is useful when
performing a git diff. It is helpful to see all the changes that were
merged into a branch.


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Where there are no content collisions between branches, automatic merging
can save time and effort and allow the developer to focus on content
where changes were made to the same content segment in multiple branches
and manually resolve the merge collisions.
